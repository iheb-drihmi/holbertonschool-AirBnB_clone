Description üè∑Ô∏è









HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface in a clone of AirBnB.

This team project is part of the (Alx) Holberton School Software Engineering program.
It represents the first step towards building a full web application.

This first step consists of:

a custom command-line interface for data management,
and the base classes for the storage of this data.

Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:






                                        $ ./console.py
                                        (hbnb) help

                                        Documented commands (type help <topic>):
                                        ========================================
                                        EOF  help  quit

                                        (hbnb) 
                                        (hbnb) 
                                        (hbnb) quit
                                        $
       
       
       
       But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
                                               $ echo "help" | ./console.py
                                        (hbnb)

                                        Documented commands (type help <topic>):
                                        ========================================
                                        EOF  help  quit
                                        (hbnb) 
                                        $
                                        $ cat test_help
                                        help
                                        $
                                        $ cat test_help | ./console.py
                                        (hbnb)

                                        Documented commands (type help <topic>):
                                        ========================================
                                        EOF  help  quit
                                        (hbnb) 
                                        $
